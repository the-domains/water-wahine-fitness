            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>About Me</h1><p>Aloha!
​
I’m Lauren Murata, a certified personal trainer and aquatic fitness professional. I specialize in group fitness classes as well as one-on-one training both in the water and on land.
​
I was not always health and fitness oriented. I was a healthy and active kid, but I was heavier than all my friends and, like many, I battled that self-image most of my life. At 19 I started modeling. I did that rather successfully, but after a few years, I decided to move on and left the business. Finally after years of dieting, I let my body do what it wanted to do—eat! At 25 I had ballooned up to a person I didn’t recognize. I was unhealthy and severely unhappy. Instead of hamming it up for the cameras, I hid from them. I lived in dresses because they were more forgiving and spared me the shame of having to buy a pair of shorts in a larger size. I knew I had to do something.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/556a0c4f7d7948c6550bcf6eca9cd15d2e4c6f45.jpg"></article>]]></description>
