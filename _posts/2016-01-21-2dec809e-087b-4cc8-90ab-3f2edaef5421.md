Aloha!
​
I'm Lauren Murata, a certified personal trainer and aquatic fitness professional. I specialize in group fitness classes as well as one-on-one training both in the water and on land.
​
I was not always health and fitness oriented. I was a healthy and active kid, but I was heavier than all my friends and, like many, I battled that self-image most of my life. At 19 I started modeling. I did that rather successfully, but after a few years, I decided to move on and left the business. Finally after years of dieting, I let my body do what it wanted to do---eat! At 25 I had ballooned up to a person I didn't recognize. I was unhealthy and severely unhappy. Instead of hamming it up for the cameras, I hid from them. I lived in dresses because they were more forgiving and spared me the shame of having to buy a pair of shorts in a larger size. I knew I had to do something.

I started working out with a trainer three times a week doing circuit and interval training. I also got into running and found the fun and feeling of accomplishment that training and completing a race can give you. And I finally really took charge of my diet; I never wanted to return to that crash-dieting self I once was. For me, it was a complete lifestyle makeover.
Dropping the weight was only the beginning. I felt like I needed to, and now could, share my insight with others. I decided to leave the corporate world and dedicate my life to doing just that. After receiving my certification as a personal trainer, I realized there was a whole other realm of fitness in water. Living in Hawaii, we are so fortunate to have gorgeous oceans and outdoor pools we can utilize 365 days a year. I had to take advantage of that!
Everyone has goals, and getting there can be tricky. Taking that first step can often be the hardest part---believe me, I know. But being healthy and feeling good---having confidence and piece of mind---is the greatest gift in the world. And everyone deserves that. I can help.
